# Be Ready for Storm Season, SPRING 2019

# _This upcoming storm for Spring 2019_ may bear some similarities to the &quot;1993 Storm of the Century,&quot; which traveled across the U.S from the Southern States to the upper East Coast. Therefore, if you live on the East Coast, I would advise you to be prepared in advance. Over 270 people died during the three-day storm between March 12th to March 14th. Some of the extreme conditions of this storm included almost 5 feet of snow, wind gusts over 70 miles an hour, and around 15 tornadoes in Florida1. This started when a jet stream of Arctic air from Canada collided with thunderstorms in the Gulf of Mexico. This collision was then joined by rain and snowstorms coming from the West Coast. The jet stream traveled in a &quot;U&quot; shape up the East coast starting with storm surges and tornadoes in Florida and leading to severe snowstorms higher up North. _Read the following preparation guide we&#39;ve provided to stay safe in case of storms in your area._

# Prepare Yourself Before a Weather Emergency Strikes

1. **Research on what type of weather emergency tends to affect the area you live in**

- [**Weather Emergencies by State**](https://alerts.weather.gov/)

- Hail and tornadoes affect southern states and snowstorms affect northern states.
- Keep regular tabs on local news outlets for storm or flood warnings

1. **Identify a safe hideout in your home where you can stay with your family to wait out any storms or floods.**

- For hurricanes, tornadoes and thunderstorms, stay away from glass windowpanes, sheds, mobile homes or tents and stay in a basement or closet.
- For floods, stay away from low ground like basements and move to higher ground, away from electrical outlets or cords. Electricity can travel through water and shock you. **2**

1. **Purchase an insurance plan, depending on your local storm likelihood, to protect your property in case of damage.**

- Flood insurance, hurricane insurance or tornado insurance
- You will need to do this at least a few months before any emergency warning is issued, as insurance companies will not be available during a storm. **3**

1. **Exchange an emergency plan with a neighbor or friend.**

- Exchange phone numbers and walkie talkies.
- Have a conversation with your friend about keeping each other up to date with any upcoming weather situations.

1. **Make a 3-day emergency kit in case your area experiences floods, hurricanes, tornadoes or snowstorms.** You may need to hideout somewhere with enough supplies to last until the storm subsides.

**Emergency Kit Items to Pack**** 4**

- Large Duffel Bag, backpack or smaller individual packs to hold items
- Water bottles (at least 4-5 packaged bottles for each family member)
- Non-perishable foods (packaged items like granola bars, crackers, dried fruit or jerky, canned goods with can opener)
- Personal Medications (any prescription pills or over the counter painkillers)
- Flashlights + Batteries
- Blankets
- First-Aid kit (with band-aids, antiseptics, gauze, alcohol swabs)
- Rain Gear (jackets, rubber boots, rubber gloves)
- Radio + batteries (for weather updates)

1. **Additional Steps to Take for Each Kind of Emergency:**
