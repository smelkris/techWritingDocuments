**About this document**
#######################

This document is an online "About us" webpage describing the company "LiveTinted," which sells cosmetic and clothing merchandise. The 
target audience is primarily women. The theme of the merchandise centers around promoting the beauty of various skin tones. Common design
elements used in this webpage include images, notes, lines and whitespace. Some design elements that were particularly appealing were the whitespaces 
that intentionally gave the webpage a more open and clear appearance. This document meets the needs of the audience by describing the foundation of the
company and how they uniquely cater to their audience. The vertical timeline on the top of the webpage describes how the CEO discovered certain
makeup techniques and combined this with her passion to promote diversity in beauty, which helps the audience to learn what her company is about.

**Usability and design improvements**
#####################################

To increase the usability of the document, they can make make the timeline horizontal as there are only 4 events on the timeline and the 2nd section
of the document, "Our Values," would be more visible to the reader. This would improve the efficiency of the document at conveying information
in a short span of time as the reader would not have to scroll down so much till the end of the vertical timeline. Another usability issue is that
the related information could be positioned where most easily noticed. Right now the section "Our Values" is way towards the bottom near the tutorial
videos and the "Refer a Friend" section. The "Our Values" and "Our Story" sections should be closer together as they both relate to the history
and the purpose of their company.

**Design principles used in document**
######################################

**Contrast**
************

Some of the elements in this page that demonstrate the use of contrast include the colors, line thickness, and shapes. The designer has used 
complementary colors of orange and blue to enhance the color contrast of the webpage. The orange is the hue of egg-yolk and is used to color 
the borders and title text while the blue is a smoky shade of blue-gray and is used in the third photo background. Also the navigation bar at the bottom 
had white text and mahogany background while the main text in the middle was black text on an orange tinted background. The variety of color contrasts 
provided me with an ability to discern the type of content I was reading (navigation tabs vs main text). The line thickness was another major contrasting
element in the webpage. The text thickness for the company name and the tabs in the navigation bar were consistently thicker than the title or the main 
text in the webpage, which only added thick text to emphasize certain words in the title. This contrast between line thickness helped bring attention to 
all words on the page as I was able to see that there were different components I should pay attention to. The shapes also contributed to the contrast on the
webpage by adding visually diverse content to keep the readerâ€™s interest. For example, pictures of women's faces wearing the cosmetics
were alternated with illustrations that represented the company's values.

**Repetition**
**************

The repetition helps create a sense of continuity in their webpage. For example, the section titles have all but one word in bold. So I know 
that when I see this type of title, it means I'm reading a different section. Also, each event on the timeline is written in the same format 
with one picture, one bold title and a brief paragraph in small font describing the event.

**Alignment**
*************

All the pictures are center aligned along with their descriptions, which shows how at least 2 elements (the picture and subtext) are aligned in the page. 
Meanwhile the main text is left aligned, which aligns with other elements on the page like the comments section and the bottom navigation bar. We see that
the designer has followed the techniques of not aligning arbitrarily and aligning with at least one other element on the page to add to the structure and 
focus of the page.

**Proximity**
*************

The designer has used proximity to organize the information by grouping similar elements together. For example, the description of the company's history and
values are positioned as the top two items while additional offers and information are presented at the very bottom near the footer navigation links. Also, 
the pictures are positioned close to the related body text underneath them, which makes it easy to see the relationship between the pictures and text.
